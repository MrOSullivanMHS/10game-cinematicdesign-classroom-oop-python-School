In this course, weâ€™re going to learn about object-oriented programming and use those skills to build an escape room game.


A famous example of this is Zork. 

Zork is one of the earliest and most famous interactive fiction computer games. Originally developed in the late 1970s by a group of MIT students, Zork is a text-based adventure game set in a fictional underground world called the Great Underground Empire. Players navigate through this world by typing commands to interact with the environment, solve puzzles, and explore various locations.

**Object-oriented** techniques are used in many programming languages, some of the more prominent being Python, Java, Swift, and C++, although there are many more. 

**Object-oriented programming** is a style of writing code in which we use objects to store and manipulate data. If you have any programming experience, you probably know how to store data in variables and use functions to run blocks of code and retrieve/manipulate that data. 

**Object-oriented programming** still uses variables and functions to store and run code; the difference is that we encapsulate all of the code within objects and classes and use these to group together related variables and functions.

We will start by learning how to print text to the console and capture user text input. 

Before we begin our project, we need to know how to produce text output and receive user input as our entire game revolves around these functions. 

We can do so through the use of the print() and input() functions, respectively.
