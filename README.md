Are you ready to dive into the thrilling world of Game & Cinematic Design?

This comprehensive course blends programming, game development, and 3D artistry.

**Python Unit**


In the Python Unit, students will master programming fundamentals, exploring variables, data structures, and control flow while gaining a solid understanding of Python syntax and structure. Emphasis on modular programming and functions will pave the way for an introduction to object-oriented programming concepts, including classes and inheritance, equipping students with the essential skills to create dynamic applications.

**Unity Unit**


The Unity Unit immerses students in game development using the powerful Unity game engine. Covering key concepts such as scene management and the GameObject component system, students will learn C# programming to design and develop both 2D and 3D games. They will implement features like physics, collision detection, and user interfaces, with a strong focus on scripting for game logic, and incorporating captivating audio and visual effects.

**Blender & Cinematic Design**


In the Blender & Cinematic Unit, students will explore the art of 3D modelling and cinematic design using Blender. They will engage with fundamental concepts such as mesh creation, texturing, and animation, while delving into lighting, camera techniques, and rendering principles. Through hands-on projects, students will create animated sequences and visual effects, honing their storytelling and visual composition skills. The curriculum emphasises the integration of audio and visual elements to elevate the cinematic experience.

Throughout the course, students will develop key competencies:


GD-1: Describe and apply design principles in the modification, development, and production of games.


GD-2: Evaluate and explain games based on their functional and aesthetic qualities.


GD-3: Communicate ideas, processes, and solutions effectively to a targeted audience.


GD-4: Collaborate in a dynamic learning environment, fostering teamwork and shared creativity.
